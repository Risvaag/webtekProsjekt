<h3>What changed</h3>


<section id = "universal"><h4>Universal changes</h4>
	<p>We changed the different font sizes due to miscalculations in the mock-up. The new font-sizes are as following:
	main title - 20 pt, subtitle - 14pt and text - 11pt. This is implemented in a css file named common.css, which all html sites link to. We also simplified the name of all subpages to make it easier for ourselves. Example: support_faq.html changed to faq.html.<p>
</section>


<section id = "homepage"><h4>Changes made to homepage.html:</h4>
	<p>We changed the two pictures on the front page to a larger size. We chose to do this, as we miscalculated how big it would be on screen. We also noticed a error in the P2 docuement "1. Homepage - homepage.html". In the mock-up picture, it says "picture of product here" and in the text it says "a picture of one the company's headquarter". The correct text is "picture of product" in both instances. <p>
</section>


<section id = "about"><h4>Changes made to about.html:</h4>
<p>This site is very similar to how it was initially planned. The only change is that the two pictures have a width of 300px instead of 550px, and automatic height adjustment instead of 400px.<p>
</section>


<section id = "employees"><h4>Changes made to about_employees.html:</h4>
	<p>The site is very similar to the mockup-picture. A change is that the picture has a width of 30 percent and automatic height adjustment, instead of 100px width and 160px height. Another change is that all the info about the employees is set to the right of the pictures. The mockup showed the names, titles and work duties without textstyle, but these topics were changed to textstyle bold.<p>
</section>


<section id = "contact"><h4>Changes made to contact.html:</h4>
	<p>The difference from the mockup is very slight, the only real difference is that the google maps API does not fit the width of the page. With a full width map, scrolling to the bottom of the page with a mouse wheel would be more difficult, as when you hit the map it interprets this as zooming out on the map rather than scrolling down.<p>
</section>


<section id = "support"><h4>Changes made to support.html:</h4>
	<p>This page is very similar to the mockup-picture. There are some small changes to both the size and placement of the comment box. Instead of being center-aligned, it is now aligned to the left. We also added a name-field and an e-mail field, so that the company have contact information on all customers who send in questions. It is not possible to send in the form without filling out all three fields. <p>
</section>


<section id = "software"><h4>Changes made to support_software.html:</h4>
	<p>We have changed the name of this page to software.html. The page is similar to how it was planned, but we added a photo to the right of the page to make it a bit more visually compelling. It also includes the JavaScript file alertBox.js. It is executed every time a link on the page is clicked, and gives the user a message that the file they are trying to access is currently unavailable. This feature is only added because the company does not exist, and we therefore have no drivers that the links can lead to. However, the links are ready to be used when there is a need. It only needs to have the onclick part in the html removed, and to add a link to where there is now a #.<p>
</section>


<section id = "manuals"><h4>Changes made to support_manuals.html:</h4>
	<p>The site is very similar to the mockup-picture. A change is that the picture has a width of 400px instead of 150px. Another change is that the links to the different manuals are represented in a list of the different versions, instead of just a single link.
It also includes the JavaScript file alertBox.js. It is executed every time a link on the page is clicked, and gives the user a message that the file they are trying to access is currently unavailable. This feature is only added because the company does not exist, and we therefore have no drivers that the links can lead to. However, the links are ready to be used when there is a need. It only needs to have the onclick part in the html removed, and to add a link to where there is now a #.<p>
</section>


<section id = "faq"><h4>Changes made to support_faq.html:</h4>
	<p>We changed the filename from support_faq.html to faq.html to make it easier for ourselves and not confuse it with support.html. This goes for all subpages. The page remains very similar to the the mock-up. There's been a slight change to the picture size and the box containing the links to the different questions and themes had to be changed to bigger size to fit all the questions. A link to the support site was added at the bottom of the page. This is convenient for a customer if he or she did not get a proper answer to their question. <p>
</section>


<section id = "products"><h4>Changes made to products.html:</h4>
	<p>Added buttons for reading more about a product to accomodate the read more feature.
Resized and moved the images into the readmore functionality as the relatively large image seemed out of place next to the shrunken text from the non expanded text.
The popup functionality was discarded along the way as other functionality was given priority.
Moved the “purchase” buttons to the center to better match the added “read more” buttons and the removal of the thumbnail from the non-expanded version of the page
Changed the functionality of the popup window as the lack of a product made the form redundant, the popup now instead informs you that the product is not currently in stock.<p>
</section>


<section id = "rollover"> 
<h4>Changes to first required javascript navBarRollover.js:</h4>
<p>This script was entirely absorbed by the dropdown.js script. We found that separating the scripts for the navbar proved less intuitive when we started to actually implement it, and it was easier to have all the functionality for the dropdown menu in one document.<p>
</section>


<section id = "dropdown"><h4>Changes to second required javascript dropdown.js:</h4>
	<p>This script absorbed all the functionality of the rollover script, and as such ended up a lot bigger than originally intended. We also ended up using this script for most of the modularity requirements for the site, namely the navbar and the footer. They are set by the functions addNavbar() and addFooter() respectively. In the end we used the dropdown part of the menu for only two pages: support and about. The mockup of the menu shows a dropdown from the menu item "products" with links to each individal product. This was dropped, since not only is there no individual page for each product, but adding them would not improve navigation of the site.<p>
</section>


<section id = "popup"><h4>Changes to third required javascript popupWindow.js:</h4>
	<p>We changed the nave of this script to alertBox.js, because we thought this was a more descriptive name for the functionality of the script. This script is largely the same as was intended in the project design phase, except for the fact that it now displays a message that the product is out of stock instead of an order form.<p>
</section>


<section id = "device"><h4>Changes to fourth required javascript deviceDetect.js:</h4>
	<p>This functions as intended. The mobile user gets a notification upon visiting the homepage that this is not a site designed to be read on a mobile device.<p> 
</section>

<section id = "css"><h4>Changes to CSS styling:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>We changed the colour of the navbar-background (and the footer divider) from a deep blue to turqouise. This change was made in order to lighten up the colourscheme, which felt a bit dark upon reflecting on it. It was also in line with a more minimalistic approach, since the mockup colour had a shading effect not present in the final navbar. The colour also more accurately reflects the logo and its colours, which was a design goal from day one. </li>
		<li>Fonts were as mentioned in the universal changes, increased all over. This was a miscalculation we soon discovered and corrected. The original values would have the text on the site appear far too small.</li>
		<li>A shadow on hover on the links in the navbar instead of italics. The dropdown also has a nice highlight colour now, both of which improve the look and feel of the navbar and provide an easy way of knowing which links are highlighted.</li>
		<li> We chose to have a separate .css-file for every page as well as a common.css. This was mostly to keep the specifics of each page separated so that we could easily keep track of them. 
		</li>
	</ul>
</section>


<section id = "homescript"><h4>Added homepage.js</h4>
	<p>As stated in the description of homepage.html in the P2 document, "The “read more” link will expand the article to full size and a “less” link will make it small again." This is what homepage.js does. <p>
</section>


<section id = "homescript"><h4>Added script.js</h4>
	<p>Functionality for the products.html page. Expands the read more button to reveal a picture and product information, and adds a popup window functionality to the purchase button. <p>
</section>


<section id = "modularity"><h4>Modularity requirement</h4>
	<p>
		We originally intended to use SSI documents to fulfill the modularity requirements, however when we started the coding we found that none of us were really familiar with it. Due to the amount of time we would spend learning this we chose to drop the menu.part and go through with the modular elements in pure javascript. This means that the navbar and footer now are loaded and implemented by a javascript (dropdown.js) on every page. The code for this might be somewhat clunky, but functions well. 
	</p>
</section>


<section id = "minrq">

<section id = "minrq"><h3>Minimum requirements</h3><p>
