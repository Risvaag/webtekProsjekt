<h3>What changed</h4>

<h4>Universal changes</h4>
<section id = "universal">We changed the different font sizes due to miscalculations in the mock-up. The new font-sizes are as following:
	main title - 20 pt, subtitle - 14pt and text - 11pt. This is implemented in a css file named common.css, which all html sites link to. We also simplified the name of all subpages to make it easier for ourselves. Example: support_faq.html changed to faq.html.</section>


<h4>Changes made to homepage.html:</h4>
<section id = "homepage">We changed the two pictures on the front page to a larger size. We chose to do this, as we miscalculated how big it would be on screen. We also noticed a error in the P2 docuement "1. Homepage - homepage.html". In the mock-up picture, it says "picture of product here" and in the text it says "a picture of one the company's headquarter". The correct text is "picture of product" in both instances. 
</section>

<h4>Changes made to faq.html:</h4>
<section id = "faq">We changed the filename from support_faq.html to faq.html to make it easier for ourselves and not confuse it with support.html. This goes for all subpages. The page remains very similar to the the mock-up. There's been a slight change to the picture size and the box containing the links to the different questions and themes had to be changed to bigger size to fit all the questions. A link to the support site was added at the bottom of the page. This is convenient for a customer if he or she did not get a proper answer to their question.
