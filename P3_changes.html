<h3>What changed</h4>

<h4>Universal changes</h4>
<section id = "universal">We changed the different font sizes due to miscalculations in the mock-up. The new font-sizes are as following:
	main title - 20 pt, subtitle - 14pt and text - 11pt. This is implemented in a css file named common.css, which all html sites link to. We also simplified the name of all subpages to make it easier for ourselves. Example: support_faq.html changed to faq.html.</section>


<h4>Changes made to homepage.html:</h4>
<section id = "homepage">We changed the two pictures on the front page to a larger size. We chose to do this, as we miscalculated how big it would be on screen. We also noticed a error in the P2 docuement "1. Homepage - homepage.html". In the mock-up picture, it says "picture of product here" and in the text it says "a picture of one the company's headquarter". The correct text is "picture of product" in both instances. 
</section>

<h4>Changes made to faq.html:</h4>
<section id = "faq">We changed the filename from support_faq.html to faq.html to make it easier for ourselves and not confuse it with support.html. This goes for all subpages. The page remains very similar to the the mock-up. There's been a slight change to the picture size and the box containing the links to the different questions and themes had to be changed to bigger size to fit all the questions. A link to the support site was added at the bottom of the page. This is convenient for a customer if he or she did not get a proper answer to their question. 
</section>


<h4>Changes made to support_manuals.html:</h4>
<section id = "manuals">The site is very similar to the mockup-picture. A change is that the picture has a width of 400px instead of 150px. Another change is that the links to the different manuals are represented in a list of the different versions, instead of just a single link.
It also includes the JavaScript file alertBox.js. It is executed every time a link on the page is clicked, and gives the user a message that the file they are trying to access is currently unavailable. This feature is only added because the company does not exist, and we therefore have no drivers that the links can lead to. However, the links are ready to be used when there is a need. It only needs to have the onclick part in the html removed, and to add a link to where there is now a #.
</section>
<h4>Changes made to contact.html:</h4>
<section id = "contact">The difference from the mockup is very slight, the only real difference is that the google maps API does not fit the width of the page. With a full width map, scrolling to the bottom of the page with a mouse wheel would be more difficult, as when you hit the map it interprets this as zooming out on the map rather than scrolling down.
</section>

<h4>Changes made to products.html:</h4>
<section id = "products">Added buttons for reading more about a product to accomodate the read more feature.
Resized and moved the images into the readmore functionality as the relatively large image seemed out of place next to the shrunken text from the non expanded text.
The popup functionality was discarded along the way as other functionality was given priority.
Moved the “purchase” buttons to the center to better match the added “read more” buttons and the removal of the thumbnail from the non-expanded version of the page
Changed the functionality of the popup window as the lack of a product made the form redundant, the popup now instead informs you that the product is not currently in stock.
</section>



<h4>Changes to first required javascript navBarRollover.js:</h4>
<section id = "rollover"> This script was entirely absorbed by the dropdown.js script. We found that separating the scripts for the navbar proved less intuitive when we started to actually implement it, and it was easier to have all the functionality for the dropdown menu in one document.
</section>

<h4>Changes to second required javascript dropdown.js:</h4>
<section id = "dropdown">This script absorbed all the functionality of the rollover script, and as such ended up a lot bigger than originally intended. We also ended up using this script for most of the modularity requirements for the site, namely the navbar and the footer. They are set by the functions addNavbar() and addFooter() respectively. In the end we used the dropdown part of the menu for only two pages: support and about. The mocupof the menu shows a dropdown from the menu item "products" with links to each individal product. This was dropped, since not only is there no individual page for each product, but adding them would not improve navigation of the site.
</section>




<h3>Minimum requirements</h3>
<section id = "minrq">
Thomas fulfilled his javascript requirements by implementing the navbar for every page, as well as a rollover effect for the navbar. He implemented dropdown.js, contact.html and contact.css
<br>
<br>
Maren has fulfilled her minimum requirements by implementing about.html, software.html and support.html
<br>
<br>
Rebekka has fulfilled her minimum requirements by implementing manuals.html, employees.html, manuals.css and employees.css.
<br>
<br>
Andreas W has fulfilled his minimum requirments by implementing homepage.html, homepage.css, faq.html, faq.css and devicedetect.js.  Additionally, he wrote and implemented common.css with Thomas. He first wrote footer.html before we decided to implement this universally using JavaScript. This was done by Andreas R.
