	<h3>History</h3>
	<p>MegaSuper Industries was founded in 2002, by the entrepeneur Sup Er K. Ewl. He got the idea to start the company when he inherited a fortune from his father in 1995, and wanted to use the money to help bettering the daily lives of ordinary people. Vaccuuming had always been something mr. K. Ewl hated, and that is how he got the idea to develop vacuum cleaners with artificial intelligence. After six years of intense developing, the first product was at last finalized, and the company was established the year later. Since 2002, many products with new and exciting features, have been released. With several products also in the making, the futurelooks bright for MegaSuper Industries!</p>
